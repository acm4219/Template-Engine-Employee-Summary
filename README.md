# Template-Engine-Employee-Summary

## Description
This application is used to make a template for your employmees to keep track of who is under your employ and what position they hold. When running the CLI you'll be able to input the type of position that you are after filling the manager role out. The choices will be between engineers and interns, and after your team members are all filled in then you will be able to create your document where it is exported to an HTML file with all of the information.

## Usage
To use this application you simply need to run node in your terminal to prompt the initial manager questions. From there you have the option to enter in more employees between interns and engineers or to end the file. If you choose either one then you'll be able to go through filling out the prompts of their information and when completed you'll be prompted again to choose between the options. If you decide to be done then you can exit the application and it will write out the last of the information to an HTML where you can display the information you've gathered.

## Challenges
There were a lot of challenges that went into this project, most of which was getting the inquirer prompt to make a fluid interface. However through a lot of troubleshooting and a good deal of help I was able to get the app up and running.

## Credits 
This was only possible through help of my classmates and instructors and the code provided by the Bootcamp.
