1. We want it to set up an employee template 
    Employee (general)
    Intern
    Engineer
    Manager
2. We need it to prompt questions about the employee 
    -could be list type of inquirer or a prompt 
        ex prompt(What is your position?) = type of template it would go to 
        ex list type = Employment type : Engineer, Manager, Intern, Employee
    -Set up the prompts for information input
        Role
        1. Name
        2. Id
        3. Email(general)/Github id(Engineer)/School(Intern)/ Office number(Manager)
3. Set up classes
    1. define what needs to be recorded (above)
    2. link the base class of employee to the other classes with the generic stuff 
    3. Save the data from the inputs to fill the template

4. Export our HTML
    1. connect the info to the HTML template from the input
    2. render it on the screen (last homework of the readme)
    3. test the CSS and style it better?

Needs
    -need to look up how to connect classes to other docs 
    -how to connect inputs (text/ strings) to the render doc (template)
    -general javascript coding for the classes

variable => () {
    
}
